This is a Match of heavenPool(Ìì³Ø), 
It provides the data of the production line, the temperature of the machine, the gas, the flow of liquid, the power, the time and so on. Through these factors, a competitor is required to design a model to accurately predict the corresponding characteristic values. This is a typical regression prediction problem. There may be exceptions in the data, the competition encourages the players to play their imagination, creativity and design intelligent algorithms.


Many methods have been tried like linear model,tree model and Mixing model,but the result isn't very well
